QS is a programming language that converts/transpiles directly to luau. 
## What is it?
QS is a programming language meant for video games which want an element of programming in the game. The QSTranspiler converts QS to luau to be ran by the ROBLOXâ„¢ engine.
## Syntax
There will be a github page for documenation but as of 11/12/2024 it does not exist. When the page is up, this section and How To Use will be replaced with a link

To use QSTranspiler, please contact me at pyluadotcode923@gmail.com as I do not have any form of tutorial available nor is any documentation avalible.
